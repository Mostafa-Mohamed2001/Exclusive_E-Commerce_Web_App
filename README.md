# Exclusive_E-Commerce_Web_App
E-Commerce web application using HTML , CSS , JavaScript ,Firebase
This project encompasses both a user-friendly customer web application (where you can browse, add to wishlists and carts, place orders, and even provide feedback!) and a robust admin application (empowering admins with full CRUD operations on products and categories, as well as the ability to manage order statuses and other administrators). We've implemented features like product filtering and ensured a responsive design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, all while leveraging Firebase Auth for secure authentication and Firebase Realtime Database for dynamic data management.
